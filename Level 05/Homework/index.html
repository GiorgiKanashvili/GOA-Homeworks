    <h3><p>N1. Python, It's like the Swiss Army knife of programming languages.

    <h3><p>N2. JavaScript, This is the language that makes websites interactive.
        If you've ever seen a website with buttons that change colors when you hover over them or a form that validates your input,
        that's JavaScript at work.</p></h3>

    <h3><P>N4. C++,  This one is like the building blocks of software. It's fast and powerful,
        so it's used to create things like computer programs, video games, 
        and software that needs to run really quickly.

    <h3><p> And last one Number 5 is C#= c sharp, Made by Microsoft, 
        C# is often used to build software for Windows computers and games for platforms like Xbox. 
        It's similar to Java in some ways but has its own special features that make it great for certain tasks.</p></h3>
